GitHub Practical Assessment

## Plan for GitHub
I plan on using GitHub to maintian the it-data-warehouse repo that holds the SQL/DDL files for the data warehouse SQL Server production instance. As well as maintain the it-pentaho repo that holds Pentaho job supporting files that don't/can't exist inside the Pentaho native repo.
